## Introduction <br />
Identifying bacteria is essential in scientific and clinical microbiology labs. Unknown bacteria are isolated, grown into pure cultures then subjected to different methods to identify its name. Accurate Identification is essential for basic science research and correct diagnosis of infectious diseases. 

Identification goes through algorithms known to microbiologists as flowcharts. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed a number of flowcharts for bacterial identification training.
